# Card√°pio Digital (Company App) üçî

Welcome to our TCC for Fatec Guaratinguet√°.

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, initiated with [`create-expo-app`](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).

## üöÄ Technologies

We utilized the following technologies:

- React Native
- Next
- Typescript
- Tailwind

## üîñ How to Run?

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Ueverson/company-app.git
cd company-app
```

## Getting Started

Begin by installing the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npx expo start
# or for web
npx expo start --web
```

If you're on an Android system, please download the Expo Go app from the Play Store. For iOS users, simply scan the QR Code with your camera app.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:19006//api/hello](http://localhost:19006//api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
