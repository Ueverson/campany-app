# Cardapio Digital (Company App) üçî

This is our TCC for Fatec Guaratinguet√°.
<br>
Also This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-expo-app`](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).

## üöÄ Tecnologias

Technologies that we used.

- React Native
- Next
- Typescript
- Tailwind

## üîñ How to Run?

#### Make a clone
```sh
    git clone git@github.com:Ueverson/campany-app.git
    cd company-app
    And thats it!
```

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
Also, it's highly recommended that you install React Native and Expo, for this run:

```bash
npx expo install react-native-web@~0.19.6 react-dom@18.2.0 @expo/webpack-config@^19.0.0
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:19006/](http://localhost:19006/) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:19006//api/hello](http://localhost:19006//api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
